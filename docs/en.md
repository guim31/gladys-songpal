# Sony Audio

Control your Sony sound bars, AV receivers and wireless speakers from Gladys, on your local
network: power, volume, mute, source, sound mode, night mode, voice enhancement and subwoofer
level, updated in real time.

## Overview

The integration talks to the devices that work with the **Sony Music Center** app (formerly
**SongPal**) through their local Audio Control API: sound bars (HT-A7000, HT-A5000, HT-ST5000,
HT-ZF9, HT-XF9000, HT-NT5…), AV receivers (STR-DN1080, STR-AN1000, STR-AZ…), wireless speakers
(SRS-X77, SRS-X99, SRS-ZR7…). No account, no cloud: everything stays on your network.

- Found by the search of the **Discovery** tab (no address to type).
- One Gladys device per product, with only the features it has.
- Real-time updates: a change made with the remote, the TV or the Sony app shows in Gladys
  within a second.
- Two dashboard widgets, a scene trigger and two scene actions.

Sony Bravia TVs use the same API but are left to the **Sony Bravia TV** integration.

## Requirements

- Gladys 5.1.0 or later.
- The device connected to your network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet), set up once with the Sony Music
  Center app.
- **Network standby on** ("Network standby", "Quick start" or "Remote start", depending on the
  model): without it the device leaves the network in standby, and Gladys cannot turn it on nor
  see it.
- Gladys and the device on the same network: the search uses SSDP (UPnP), relayed by Gladys.
  Across subnets, type the address of the device in the configuration.

## Installation and configuration

1. In Gladys, open **Integrations → Install from GitHub** and install
   `https://github.com/guim31/gladys-songpal` (or install **Sony Audio** from the store).
2. Turn your device on (not in standby) so that it gives its sources and sound settings.
3. Open the **Discovery** tab of the integration and start a search. Each device found shows with
   its features: add it to Gladys.
4. Optional, in **Configuration**:
   - **Addresses (optional)**: only for a device the search does not find, its IP address
     (several separated by commas, e.g. `192.168.1.30, 192.168.1.31`). Give it a fixed address in
     your router.
   - **Refresh interval**: how often a device is read when it cannot send its changes (30 seconds
     by default).
   - **Volume step of the widget**: how much the **Volume −** and **Volume +** buttons change the
     volume.
   - **Language of the feature names**: the names given to the features of a new device, and the
     language of the messages (French by default).
5. **Test the connection** reads every known device and tells what it finds: on or in standby,
   source, volume, and whether live updates work.

## Devices and features

Each product is one device, identified by its MAC address (a new IP address given by your router
keeps the same device: search again, it is found at its new address). Only the features the
device has are created:

Choosing a source while the device is in standby turns it on first. A receiver is controlled on
its main zone.

## Gladys 5.3 Music player

Since version 1.1.0 (Gladys 5.3 at least), a sound bar, receiver or speaker that can pause becomes
a real player in the dashboard **Music** widget: title, artist, album, artwork when the device
gives one, progress bar, play / pause / stop, previous / next, volume and mute. Use that widget
first; the _Sony Audio remote_ widget stays for the source and the sound mode.

- **Devices already added**: search again in the Discovery tab, then click **Update** on the
  device. The new features are added, the old ones keep their ids (scenes and dashboards keep
  working), and **Mute** becomes the music mute.
- On an input (HDMI, TV, optical) nothing is "loaded": the state is **stopped** and the texts are
  empty. A scene that waited for "Playback = 0" on an input must now look for 2.
- No library, queue or search: the Sony API does not expose them reliably. No shuffle or repeat
  either.
- Moving within the track works on a USB stick only; anywhere else Gladys shows a clear refusal.

## Widgets

- **Sony Audio remote**: the device and its state, its source, sound mode and volume, with four
  buttons: **Turn on** (or **Standby**), **Volume −**, **Volume +** and **Mute** (its icon is a
  check mark while muted).
- **Sony Audio sources**: four favorite sources in one tap, the device turned on if needed. Type
  their names in the widget settings (e.g. `TV`, `HDMI 1`, `Bluetooth`); empty, the first
  connected inputs. The source in use has a check mark.

Choose the device in the settings of each widget (the first one otherwise).

## Scene trigger

**Sony Audio: source changed**: the input in use changed, whatever changed it: the TV over HDMI
(turning the TV on often switches the sound bar to it), a console, the remote, the Sony app or
Gladys. Turning the device on counts when it lands on another source than the last one.

- Filters: the device, and the new source, written exactly as in the source list of the device
  (e.g. `HDMI 1`; empty: any source).
- Variables: the device name, the new source, the previous source.

## Scene actions

- **Sony Audio: choose a source**: by its name as the device shows it (`TV`, `HDMI 1`,
  `Bluetooth`; case and spaces do not matter). Turns the device on first if needed. Returns the
  source chosen.
- **Sony Audio: set the sound**: in one step, the sound mode by its name (`Movie`, `Music`), night
  mode and voice enhancement (on, off or unchanged), and the volume. Turns the device on first if
  needed. Returns the sound mode and the volume.

## Scene examples

- **Movie night**: when the "Movie" scene runs, **Sony Audio: choose a source** `TV`, then **Sony
  Audio: set the sound** with `Movie`, voice enhancement on and volume 18; dim the lights.
- **Quiet at night**: every day at 22:00, if the sound bar is on, set **Night mode** on and the
  **Subwoofer level** down.
- **Console time**: with **Sony Audio: source changed** filtered on `HDMI 2`, turn on the lamp of
  the TV cabinet and send a message "The console is on".

## Troubleshooting

- **The search finds nothing**: check that the device is on the same network as Gladys, with
  network standby on, and that it shows in the Sony Music Center app. Your router may drop
  multicast between Wi-Fi and Ethernet: type the address in **Addresses (optional)**.
- **"does not answer (unplugged, or network standby off)"**: the device left the network. Turn on
  network standby in its settings. Its Gladys device stays, its power shows off until it answers.
- **No live updates** (the test says "live updates off"): the device does not accept the
  WebSocket connection; it is read at the refresh interval instead. Nothing to change.
- **A source or a sound mode is missing**: the lists are those the device gives when on. Turn it
  on, then start a search again: the lists of an added device are updated without touching it.
- **A feature appears after an update**: a device added while in standby had no sound settings
  yet; the **Discovery** tab proposes to update it.
- Logs: the integration writes little (start, devices lost and back, user actions). For more,
  set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` on the integration.

## Limits

- Developed without the hardware: built from the Sony Audio Control API reference and the
  open-source projects that use it. Some models may name their settings differently.
- The device must stay on the network in standby to be turned on from Gladys (no Wake-on-LAN).
- Only the main zone of a receiver; no multi-room groups, no presets, no browsing of the network
  services, no equalizer bands.
- Play and pause depend on the source: an HDMI or TV input cannot be paused from the sound bar.
- The device is read at most every 10 seconds when it cannot notify, every 5 minutes otherwise;
  the API is local, without quota.
- Bravia TVs are left to the Sony Bravia TV integration.
